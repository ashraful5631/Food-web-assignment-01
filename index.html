        <h1>Healthy Food Essay for Students</h1>
        <p>Healthy food refers to food that contains the right amount of nutrients to keep our body fit. We need healthy food to keep ourselves fit. Furthermore, healthy food is also very delicious as opposed to popular thinking. Nowadays, kids need to eat healthy food more than ever. <br> <br>
            
            We must encourage good eating habits so that our future generations will be healthy and fit. Most importantly, the harmful effects of junk food and the positive impact of healthy food must be stressed upon. People should teach kids from an early age about the same.</p>
